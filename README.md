Tor.framework is the easiest way to embed Tor in your iOS application. The API is *not* stable yet, and subject to change.

Currently, the framework compiles in static versions of `tor`, `libevent`, `openssl`, and `liblzma`:

|          |         |
|:-------- | -------:|
| tor      | 0.3.5.8 |
| libevent | 2.1.8   |
| OpenSSL  | 1.1.0i  |
| liblzma  | 5.2.3   |

## Requirements

- iOS 8.0 or later
- Xcode 7.0 or later
- `autoconf`,  `automake`,  `libtool` and  `gettext` in your `PATH`

## Installation

Embedded frameworks require a minimum deployment target of iOS 8 or OS X Mavericks (10.9).

If you use `brew`, make sure to install `autoconf`,  `automake`,  `libtool` and  `gettext`:

```
brew install automake autoconf libtool gettext
```

### Initial Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:iCepa/Tor.framework

cd Tor.framework

git submodule init
git submodule update

carthage build --no-skip-current --platform iOS
```

### Carthage

To integrate Tor into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your  `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "iCepa/Tor.framework" "master"
```

The above method will configure Carthage to fetch and compile Tor.framework from source. 
Alternatively, you may use the following to use binary-compiled versions of Tor.framework that 
correspond to releases in GitHub:

```ogdl
binary "https://icepa.github.io/Tor.framework/Tor.json" == 305.7.1
```

For available precompiled versions, see [docs/Tor.json](docs/Tor.json). Since Tor 0.3.5.2, 
the Tor.framework release version numbers follow the format "ABB.C.X" for tor version "0.A.B.C" 
and Tor.framework release X (for that version of Tor). Note that the "BB" slot is a two-digit number, 
with a leading zero, if necessary. "305.2.1" is the first release from tor 0.3.5.2.

#### Building a Carthage Binary archive

For maintainers/contributors of Tor.framework, a new precompiled release can be generated by 
doing the following:

Ensure that you have committed changes to the submodule trees for tor, libevent, openssl, and xz.

In `Tor/version.sh`, increment the `TOR_BUNDLE_SHORT_VERSION_STRING` version per the 
format described above. Change `TOR_BUNDLE_SHORT_VERSION_DATE` to the current date. 
Commit these changes.

Create a git tag for the version, and then 
[build + archive the framework](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/#archive-prebuilt-frameworks-into-one-zip-file):

```bash
carthage build --no-skip-current

carthage archive Tor
```
(This generates a `Tor.framework.zip` file in the repo.)

Then create a [release](https://github.com/iCepa/Tor.framework/releases) in GitHub which corresponds
to the tag, attach the generated `Tor.framework.zip` to the release.

Add a corresponding entry to [docs/Tor.json](docs/Tor.json), commit & push that so that it becomes 
available at https://icepa.github.io/Tor.framework/Tor.json

## Usage

Starting an instance of Tor involves using three classes: `TORThread`, `TORConfiguration` and `TORController`.

Here is an example of integrating Tor with `NSURLSession`:

```objc
TORConfiguration *configuration = [TORConfiguration new];
configuration.cookieAuthentication = @(YES);
configuration.dataDirectory = [NSURL URLWithString:NSTemporaryDirectory()];
configuration.controlSocket = [configuration.dataDirectory URLByAppendingPathComponent:@"control_port"];
configuration.arguments = @[@"--ignore-missing-torrc"];

TORThread *thread = [[TORThread alloc] initWithConfiguration:configuration];
[thread start];

NSURL *cookieURL = [configuration.dataDirectory URLByAppendingPathComponent:@"control_auth_cookie"];
NSData *cookie = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:cookieURL];
TORController *controller = [[TORController alloc] initWithSocketURL:configuration.controlSocket];
[controller authenticateWithData:cookie completion:^(BOOL success, NSError *error) {
    if (!success)
        return;

    [controller addObserverForCircuitEstablished:^(BOOL established) {
        if (!established)
            return;

        [controller getSessionConfiguration:^(NSURLSessionConfiguration *configuration) {
            NSURLSession *session = [NSURLSession sessionWithConfiguration:configuration];
            ...
        }];
    }];
}];
```

## Known Issues

- Nobody takes care having it working on MacOS, currently, so builds will probably break on that platform.

- The xcconfigs dependency currently seems unused. Probably can be removed, but somebody
  needs to do some archeology to determine, why it was used and if we should re-enable that
  functionality or instead remove the dependency.
